# Project Features

- Users can select courses according to their choice and add those courses in the cart.
- Users can track their credit hour limit and they will be notified when credit hour limit is over.
- Users can calculate total price of the courses they select

# How I managed the state in this assignment project :

- I have used useState hook to keep track and update the data of courses.
- I have used useEffect hook to fetch data from API.
- Then I have passed the state data as props to child components.
